# Find!

Simply find what you want, where you know you'll find it.

## Setup

- Visit [find.hugurp.org](https://find.hugurp.org) with your favorite web browser
- Add this webpage as your search engine. Here is where how, with:
-- Firefox, click the magnifying glass icon (it has a green "+") in
the search bar, then click the `Add "Find!" button`. [Check if it
worked here](about:preferences#search), it should now appear in the
"One-click search engines" list. You can double click its `Keyword`
column to customize how it will be triggered, we recommand you to put
the letter `f` (short for "find").
-- For Chrome/Chromium, go to [the search engines settings
page](chrome://settings/searchEngines). In the "Other search engines"
section, click the "add" button. Add the search engine with the
following values: Seach engine: `Find`, Keyword: `f`, Query URL: `https://find.hugurp.org?q=%s`.


## Usage

## Configuration

Except the `keyword` you will use to trigger the search engine (we
recommand `f`), or setting `Find!` as your *default search engine* in
your web browser, there are no configuration.

In this case we think the [Convention over
configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)
moto makes a lot of sense, to start usage very quickly.

## Customization

No configuration does not mean you cannot customize your usage. If you
would like, this software is [Free
software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).

You can find the code on (Github)[https://github.com/hugurp/find], and
customize as you want.
